## Cyclistic Case Study
It is one of the three case studies provided at the end of Google Data Analytics Certification. I have recently completed all the 7 courses in this program which included all the necessary steps for Data Analysis:
Ask<br>
Prepare<br>
Process<br>
Analyze<br>
Share<br>
Act<br>

## The Background Scenario

Cyclistic is an imaginary bike-sharing company that operates in Chicago, Illinois. I roleplayed as a data analyst working in the company's marketing analyst team.

Cyclistic has two types of customers: annual members and casual customers. The director of marketing believes that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of  annual members.

## The Questions
* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? <br>
* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?<br>
* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?<br>
At first, I felt tense about how I could answer all these questions, considering that I had just completed the certification and my knowledge was limited. However, I decided to invest some time in reading the objectives and approached the task by starting with some basic questions in my mind. As I progressed, I began to understand that I had all the necessary knowledge to find the answers. I realised that I just needed to connect the little pieces I knew in order to create a method to answer the questions.

## The Data

The Data Iâ€™m working on is of First Party Type. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this Licence (https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)
The data integrity was checked and deemed unbiased.

Here is the source of data

This includes data from 2014 but in order to completely make my data ROCCC i.e Reliable, original, comprehensive, current ans cited, I will use data of 2022 from january to december, so i will work in a total of 12 csv files.
